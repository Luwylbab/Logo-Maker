# Logo Maker

## Description

This repo contains the content for week 10

- I wanted to create a tool that could help someone make a simple logo without having to pay a graphic designer.
- The application can take a user's inputs and make a simple but fully customized logo for free.
- I learned more about about node, running tests, classes, and importing and exporting the script.

## Installation

- Get SSH key from https://github.com/Luwylbab/Logo-Maker

- Clone the repository using [git@github.com:Luwylbab/Logo-Maker.git]

## Usage

When a user runs the node command in the terminal, they will be asked as series of questions. First, the user will need to select a shape for their logo, then the color of the shape. After that, the user will get to type in any text of their choosing so long as it is 3 character or less. Finally, the user can type any color or hex code for the text color. Once all that is completed, an svg file will be uploaded to the example.svg file, and can be opened in the browser to view the logo.
